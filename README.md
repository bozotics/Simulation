# Simulation

## Disclaimer
This is still in the **very *very* early stages of undoneness**. Hence, the code design itself is *extremely* messy and is ***not*** representative of what the final/future iterations of the program will look like.
Nonetheless, we have still uploaded this as a proof of concept/proof of work done on this topic. Do follow us on Instagram [@bozotics](https://www.instagram.com/bozotics/) to stay updated with our developmental progress

## Setup (poetry)
We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install our dependencies.

1. Install [poetry here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
2. Run ```poetry install```
3. Run ```poetry run python3 sim.py```
4. !!

## (NOT RECOMMENDED) Setup (pip)
Alternatively, run ```pip3 install arcade pymunk``` and then ```python3 sim.py```
[Arcade](https://arcade.academy/) is used for drawing of the elements in the game.
[Pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/) is the 2D physics library.
