# Simulation

## Disclaimer
This is still in the **very *very* early stages of undoneness**. Hence, the code design itself is *extremely* messy and is not representative of what the final/future iterations of the program will look like.
Nonetheless, we have still uploaded this as a proof of concept/proof of work done on this topic. Do follow us on Instagram [@bozotics](https://www.instagram.com/bozotics/) to stay updated with our developmental progress

## Setup?
Install [Arcade](https://arcade.academy/) (describe what this is) and [Pymunk](http://www.pymunk.org/en/latest/) (describe what this is) libraries. 

## Heading
Point out what part of the code is what idk?
